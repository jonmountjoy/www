I'm Jon. I travel a fair bit, eat a lot, work, and try to live my life as best I can. This page is an attempt to pull all these threads together.

I love ideas, and discussing them. I suspect I'm happiest when eating with friends, learning interesting things. Particularly about human behaviour, evolution, genetics and related fields. I've put together a list of interests below, and I very infrequently write about a few of them on my blog. I occassionally program too. I once wrote a book about Enterprise Java, and now dabble in Ruby, Swift and React Native.
