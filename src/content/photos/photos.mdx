I enjoy traveling, and visited approximately 50 cities in the past 18 months - mostly in Europe, but also in Africa. I'd like to travel more; it makes me feel small. The world is big, and traveling reminds me of my insignificance - and somehow that reminds me that anything is possible, in a good way. I quite enjoy taking photographs when traveling. On the other, I sometimes suffer from vem√∂dalen, the "frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist."
