I'm building a mobile app, for iOS and Android.  The app will be a form of spaced-repetition, targeting students, scholars, and anyone else interested in remembering and connecting facts.  A bunch of technologies are involves.  Primarily, it's React Native (with TypeScript) for the mobile app itself, and a combination of Ruby and Google Firebase for the server back-end.
